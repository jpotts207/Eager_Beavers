			Plan !T is a web-based application that will help a group of individuals schedule
			an event at the most convenient time for all of them.<br/><br/>

			Plan !T can be used to arrange single events such as going to the cinema to see
			the latest blockbuster or it could be used to organize an extended event such as
			a camping trip with friends.<br/><br/>

			This application isn’t just for social planning but can be used to plan your next
			business meeting, study session or family reunion.<br/><br/>

			So how does Plan !T work?<br/><br/>

			Registered users will be able to create an event and in doing so, invite anyone
			from their Friends List. These friends could be mates, work colleagues or family
			members and can be arranged accordingly into Groups.<br/><br/>
			
			Once an event has been created, invitations are sent automatically to those who
			been invited. That invitation includes a link to allow the potential attendees
			to nominate when they are available to attend.<br/><br/>

			That’s the beauty of Plan !T, it won’t lock in a specific time or date until after
			everyone who’s been invited has RSVPed and then nominated their own
			availability.<br/><br/>

			Once everyone has indicated when they can and cannot attend, Plan !T will
			collate that information and let the event’s creator know the most convenient time
			that all invitees are available to attend.<br/><br/>
			
			That’s when the event organizer can lock in a time according to when’s best for
			everyone and send out the final invitations. This way there’s no need to go back
			and forth to find out who is available to see the 12:00pm screening of that latest
			blockbuster on Saturday afternoon and who’s not, because Plan !T will tell you
			based on what you tell it.<br/><br/>
			
			The other wonderful thing is that you’ll be able to see what everyone else is
			telling Plan !T too. So, at a quick glance, you’ll be able to see just how many
			attendees are going to be available at certain times or on certain days. This gives
			everyone a chance to be ahead of the game as they’ll be able to see when
			people are available and when they’re not, so they can immediately start
			penciling in times or ruling them out.<br/><br/>

			Don’t worry about forgetting when that event is either, you’ll get a reminder
			notification to let you know that it’s happening. Not just one reminder either, Plan
			!T will tell you 1 week before the event, 1 day before the event and then on the
			actual day it will give you a final reminder, so you’ll have no excuse for not
			attending.<br/><br/>
			
			Afraid you’ll double-book yourself? Don’t be. Plan !T can sync with your chosen
			calendar and insert all the events you’re invited to, so you’ll know it’s there even
			without the reminder notifications Plan !T will send you. Just another convenient
			way to make sure you don’t forget what’s happening.<br/><br/>

			Weren’t sure where the event was taking place or how to get there? Plan !T has
			you covered there as well. Location services are enabled to allow individuals
			creating an event to add the location or even search for it and add it to the event.
			It’ll be part of the invitation that gets sent out to everyone that’s invited to attend.
			That way they’ll be able to see exactly what’s in the neighbourhood including
			restaurants, public transport facilities and even parking.<br/><br/>

			What if, heaven forbid, there is no convenient time for everyone? Plan !T caters
			for that unfortunate situation too. Sometimes someone may have to miss out.
			Sad but true. Plan !T will be able to tell you though when most people are
			available. The show must go on! One or two people might not be able to enjoy
			the fun, but that’s better than having everyone suffer. It might just be that little
			nudge someone needs to rearrange their schedule, so they don’t miss out on all
			the fun.<br/><br/>
			
			Plan !T is the scheduling application you never knew you needed and will be glad
			you do. You’ll never have to double-check who’s available when because that’s
			what Plan !T is for.<br/><br/>
			Let Plan !T plan it for you.
